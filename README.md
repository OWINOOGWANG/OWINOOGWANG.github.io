###  DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT'S PURPOSE
I belive life is too short and so for the time i am alive i am going to do my best to make the world a better place and leave a positive impact on peoples lives. To me **photography** is not just an art but a **powerfull tool** through which **humanity** can be made to see where it has gone wrong and be reminded that **creations have spirits**,one thing that we seem to have forgotten hence the vices we see in the world today.It is for this reason that i plan to use my life experince,education,skills and talent to create a webpage that acts as a tool for **social reform**.
